List of dependencies (each with authorship details):

mTRF-Toolbox - The Multivariate Temporal Response Function Toolbox
               https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00604/full
               https://github.com/mickcrosse/mTRF-Toolbox
               https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74260-mtrf-toolbox
               https://sourceforge.net/projects/aespa/
               https://psyarxiv.com/jbz2w/

EEGLAB -       https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php
               Used for data loading, channel interpolation, and topographical plots

NoiseTools -   Alain de Cheveigne's Matlab toolbox
               (e.g., robust detrending, robust PCA, CCA, MCCA)

cnsp_utils -   Useful collection of scripts and functions. Part of these functions were
               written or modified for the CNSP-Workshop. Part of these functions were
               previously shared by other authors. Please refer to the Matlab code and
               readme files for details on the authorship of specific functions. If you
               use those functions, please remember to acknowledge each of the authors.
               Functions starting with "mTRF" are functions written to extend the
               mTRF-Toolbox that, however, are not part of the official toolbox yet.
